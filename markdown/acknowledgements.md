\section*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor, Torgeir.
When I started to get genuinely interested in bioinformatics back in 2010, he was the one who gave me my first bioinformatics project, and see where that led me.
Always pushing me just enough, and having a knack for asking me the right questions.

I am forever grateful to my parents, always supporting me in whatever endeavour I have embarked on, and for always making sure I have both feet on the ground.

Thank you, Rickard and Peter, for the late-night Battlefield sessions in the past year that have worked wonders for me in order to blow off some steam.

Without all the people at Umeå Plant Science Centre I don't think I would be where I am today.
It was here that I got the inspiration to pursue a PhD in the first place.
Thanks to David for nice discussions and for lending out his couch whenever I visited, and a big thanks to Jing for contributing to the more hard-core genetics side of things.
A special thank you goes out to Nat and Tiggy for providing me with interesting data and for guiding me through the more hairy biology.
Working together with you has been a huge source of inspiration to me, and for that you have my gratitude.

Last but not least, the Biostatistics group.
What an amazing collection of people, always having their doors and minds open.
It has been a privilege sharing the workplace with you, and I will miss the coffee breaks in the appendix, the fishing stories, the marathon/Birken/factor discussions, the food festivals, the Bollywood dancing, as well as all the electric car propaganda.
There were seldom boring moments, much thanks to the party committee led by Navreet and Guro. You are all awesome!
