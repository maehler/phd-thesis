\section*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor, Torgeir.
When I started to get genuinely interested in bioinformatics back in 2010, he was the one who gave me my first bioinformatics project, and see where that led me.
Always pushing me just enough, and having a knack for asking me the right questions.

I am forever grateful to my parents, always supporting me in whatever endeavour I have embarked on, and for always making sure I have both feet on the ground.

Thank you, Rickard and Peter, for the late-night Battlefield sessions in the past year that have worked wonders for me in order to blow off some steam.

Without all the people at Umeå Plant Science Centre I don't think I would be where I am today.
It was here that I got the inspiration to pursue a PhD in the first place.
Thanks to David for lending out his couch whenever I visited, and a big thanks to Jing for contributing to the more hard-core genetics side of things.
A special thank you goes out to Nat and Tiggy for always being there to correct my crappy English and answer my naïve biology questions.
Without their contributions I would have been at least two papers short.

Last but not least, the Biostatistics group.
What an amazing collection of people always having their doors and minds open.
In case you had some onscure R question, or just wanted to see a cool plot, Lars Jr.\ was the go-to guy.
I will miss the coffee breaks in the appendix, the fishing stories of Lars Sr\., the marathon/Birken ramblings from Trygve and Solve, as well as all the electric car propaganda (I'm looking at you Hilde).
There were seldom boring moments, much thanks to the party committee led by Navreet and Guro. All in all, you're awesome!
