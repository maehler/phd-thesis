## Background

Some phenotypes are simple to explain from a genetic point of view.
Perhaps the most famous example are the experiments conducted by Gregor Mendel between 1856 and 1863.
He crossed pea plants (\textit{Pisum sativum}) having different properties; some were green, some were yellow, some had wrinkly seeds while others had smooth seeds.
He then observed how these traits were passed down to the next generation of pea plants and thus laid the foundation for what we today refer to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance.
This is something that is so fundamental in biology today that parts of it are taught already in primary school.
Perhaps Mendel was just lucky, because most traits are much more complex than the ones he described [@Barsh2003; @Speliotes2010; @Wood2014].
One example of a phenotype that has been notoriously difficult to explain is human height.
Human height has a very high heritability, i.e.\ a large portion of the variation in human height can be explained by genetic differences [@Visscher2008], but studies that have tried to identify the genetic factors that contribute to the variation in human height have not succeeded to explain things as well and as simple as Mendel explained the colour of his peas.
In a recent study, a large team of researchers identified 697 genetic variants that were associated with human height, and together these variants only explained 20 percent of the variation [@Wood2014].
This is the definition of a complex trait; a trait that can only be explained by the combination of a large number of small effects that individually can be very hard to detect.
Another way of putting it is that the complex traits are emergent properties arising from a combination of smaller factors that in themselves are not as complex.
These types of traits are often also referred to as non-Mendelian or polygenic, indicating that they are determined by multiple genes, and possibly the interaction between these genes.
It is important to note, however, that the individual effects that contribute to the trait do follow the laws of Mendel---it is just that the combination of these effects manifests themselves in a way that does not allow the trait to be dissected in the same way as pea colour.

In the case of Mendel's pea plants, the traits were very visible and the difference between plants was easy to assess.
There is however more subtle variation in all natural populations.
In humans, variation might be manifested as susceptibility to disease, and in trees, this could be something as minuscule as the texture of the bark or the width of the leaves.
This variability can be a result of genotype alone, environmental factors alone, or a combination of these.
A long lived debate in this area of research is the nature versus nurture debate, i.e.\ whether a particular trait arises from genetics or from the environment.
Today the general consensus is that most traits are a result of both genotype and the environment that the genotype is subjected to.
To add additional complexity, there is also interaction between the genotype and the environment (or G\texttimes{}E), a phenomenon where different genotypes respond differently to changes in environment [@Falconer1996].
Twin studies have often been used to study these types of interactions.
For example, if identical twins separated at birth remain very similar, albeit not absolutely identical, for a particular phenotypic trait, this trait is inferred to be under tight genetic control [@Bouchard1990a].
Consequently, the trait is then also highly heritable and is environmentally invariant.

@Fig:overview shows an overview of how information travels from the DNA via RNA to proteins and metabolites (the central dogma of molecular biology) and how these interact to give rise to complex phenotypes.
This introduction will go through this figure one concept at a time and explain the underlying biology, the data we retrieve from this biology, and finally, methods used to analyse the data.

As the foundation we have the genome sequence with its genes and variation.
This gives rise to complex traits by expressing genes that in turn interact with each other in biochemical pathways that in the end can be observed as, for example, leaf shape.](figures/overview.pdf){#fig:overview width=100%}
