## Background

Some phenotypes are simple to explain from a genetic point of view. Perhaps the most famous example are the experiments by Gregor Mendel conducted between 1856 and 1863. He crossed pea plants (\textit{Pisum sativum}) having different properties; some were green, some were yellow, some were wrinkly, some were smooth. He then observed how these traits were passed down to the next generation of pea plants and thus laid the foundation for what we today refer to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance. This is something that is so fundamental in biology that it is taught already in primary school. Perhaps Mendel was just lucky, because most traits are much more complex than the ones he described [REF]. One example of a phenotype that has been notoriously difficult to explain is human height. Human height has a very high heritability, i.e.\ a large portion of the variation in human height can be explained by genetic factors, but studies that have tried to identify the factors that contribute to the variation in human height has not succeeded to explain things as well and as simple as Mendel explained the colour of his peas. In a recent study a large team of researchers managed to find 697 genetic variants that were associated with human height, but together these variants only explained 20 percent of the variation [@Wood2014]. This is the definition of a complex trait; a trait that can only be explained by the combination of a large number of small effects that individually can be very hard to detect.

<!-- Human height can also be seen as an emergent property, i.e.\ a property that is the result of many small effects that individually explain almost nothing of the emergent property, while in concert, they are able to... -->

@Fig:overview shows an overview of how information travels from the DNA via RNA to proteins and metabolites and how these interact to give rise to complex phenotypes. This introduction to this thesis will go through this figure one concept at a time and explain the underlying biology, the data we retrieve from this biology, and finally, methods used to analyse the data.

In the case of Mendel's pea plants, the traits were very visible and the difference between plants was easy to assess. There is however more subtle variation in all natural populations. In humans it might be manifested as differences in height or eye colour, and in trees, this could be something so minuscule as the texture of the bark or the width of the leaves. This variability can be a result of environment, [EXAMPLE], or it can be a direct result of genotypic differences [blood type example], but it is almost always a combination of environment and genotype.

<!-- This phenotypic variation is a manifestation of one of the most fundamental requirements for evolution; without natural variation we would not have evolution. -->

<!-- The reason for this variation is that the machinery responsible for making new organisms, be it sexual or asexual reproduction, is error-prone. Whenever a cell divides, there is a possibility for errors. Over time these errors can accumulate, disappear or be fixed in a population depending on whether they are beneficial, neutral or even harmful for the organism. -->
