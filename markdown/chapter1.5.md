## Integration of different types of data

From the sections on gene expression and association studies above, we see that it is possible to explain some of the variability in complex traits using these resources directly. The natural follow-up to this is whether we can gain even more from combining these sources of information. From @fig:overview it is evident GWAS and eQTL mapping represent related, but still distinct approaches. If we combine these two types of association studies, are we able to see even more in a kind of a step-wise fashion starting at the level of the genome, using the variation to explain the variation in gene expression, and finally the variation in phenotypes.

- Using the combination of data from the sections above to try to get an integrated view on how these phenotypes emerge.
- Are we able to explain more by using different types of data that represent different layers of the (hidden) regulatory network.
- Overlap between GWAS SNPs and eQTL SNPs
- The recent functional genomics in yeast special issue might be useful for this section: http://bfg.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/2.toc
