## Limitations {#sec:limitations}

- Limited range of populations, e.g. we look at Sweden, which is only a small part of the global aspen population.
- Gene expression and phenotypic sampling is limited to the moment that you sample. The half-life of mRNA is relatively short, and it varies throughout the year, and even throughout the day. If you sample at the wrong time, you might miss the signals that are of significant for the particular trait you are interested in.
- Rare variants and information content
- Low effect variants: how many samples do you need? Human height study with 200k samples.
- Even though I've been saying that the regulatory genome is a big thing, a lot of annotations are still focused on coding genes. In order to fully understand gene expression regulation, non-coding genes must get better annotations, and they must also be included in eQTL mapping efforts.
- Missing heritability: in most cases only a part of the phenotypic variation can be explained by genetic variants and environment. The rest is referred to as missing heritability. In reality this heritability is of course not missing; it is just due to factors that we cannot observe for some reason or another. For example, there might be rare genetic variants that affects the phenotypic outcome that we are not able to detect without a very large sample size. In some cases, it might even be the case that the whole global population would not be enough to find a statistically significant relationship for some variants. Also, epistatis plays a big role in this as well, and is also very hard to outline because of the huge number of possible combinations of genetic variants.
- Some limitations are brought up in [@Mathelier2015]: the importance of good annotations and previous rigorous studies. Model organisms that have been studied for a long time have a huge advantage here. This is not saying that the information from these studies cannot be transferred to other species, but they will need a proper breakdown in other species as well. Hopefully the studies in e.g.\ humans can help other areas as well.
