In biology, the emergence of phenotypic traits has been of interest to researchers ever since the early days of biology. You could say that agriculture through the history has been applied quantitative genetics in a way. The urge and need of new and improved varieties of crops has resulted in the most remarkable transformations of phenotypes, like the domestication of the grass teosinte to the cornstalks of today. The development of these new crop varieties has been done with breeding strategies; you breed individuals with certain characteristics to get new individuals with possibly improved traits. In the mid 19th century, Gregor Mendel uncovered the basics of genetic inheritance and was able to explain the passing down of traits in peas. This is something that holds up even today, but what we have found out is that not all traits are this simple. Instead of being controlled by one or two genes, like the traits that Mendel investigated, they are controlled by hundreds or even thousands of genes. Not only are there many loci involved, the effect of each individual locus on the phenotype is generally very small.

The differences in genome sequence is what generally is associated with the phenotypes of interest, but this is of little interest unless more information is available. The changes in genome sequence are manifested as changes in gene expression levels, or changes in protein sequences (and possibly protein function), to mention a few examples. In order to get a complete picture of how phenotypes change based on changes in genome sequence, the intermediate layers (gene expression, protein abundance, metabolite abundance) must be included as well.

With this thesis, we aim to shine some light on gene regulation and the emergence of complex traits. In paper I gene regulation in the cyanobacterium *Synechocystis* is explored by integrating regulatory motifs with co-expression networks. Paper II concerns the determination of sex in *Populus tremula* using phenotype data, gene expression data, and genotype data. In paper III, the focus is directed towards the genetic component of gene expression (eQTL) and how this fits into a co-expression network context. Finally, paper IV expands on this by adding genotype--phenotype associations in addition to eQTLs and gene expression to explain leaf shape in *Populus tremula*.
