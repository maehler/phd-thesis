The emergence of complex traits in living organisms has been of interest to biologists since the early days of biology.
Domestication and breeding has resulted in the most remarkable transformations, such as the grass teosinte turning into the cornstalks of today, or the variation that can be seen among different breeds of dogs.
In the mid 19th century, Gregor Mendel uncovered the basics of genetic inheritance and was able to explain the passing down of traits in peas.
Not all traits are this simple to dissect, however, since they are controlled by several genes; these are collectively called complex traits.
Due to the large number of genes in a species, it is simply not possible to explore the space of all gene combinations exhaustively.
New sequencing technologies however makes it possible obtain so-called omics data on multiple aspects of a biological system and these data can be integrated in order to narrow down the search space and focus on the functional gene combinations.

Variations in the genome sequence has traditionally has been studied in order to understand the phenotypes of interest, however, although this is the ultimate cause of phenotypic variation, phenotypes can be understood at many levels, several of them being much closer to the phenotype than the genome sequence.
The changes in genome sequence are manifested as changes in gene expression levels, or changes in protein sequences in turn leading to changes in protein function, protein interactions, metabolite levels and gene regulation.
In order to obtain a complete picture of how phenotypes change based on changes in genome sequence, these intermediate layers must be included as well.

In this thesis, we aim to shine some light on gene regulation and the emergence of complex traits.
In paper I, gene regulation in the cyanobacterium *Synechocystis* is explored by integrating regulatory motifs with co-expression networks, and a web tool is developed to make the results interactively available to the research community.
Paper II investigates the sexual dimorphism in *Populus tremula* using phenotype data, gene expression data, and genotype data.
In paper III, the focus is directed towards the genetic component of gene expression variation and how this can be understood in the context of a co-expression network.
Finally, paper IV expands on paper III by adding genotype--phenotype associations, in addition to eQTLs and gene expression, in order to dissect leaf shape in *Populus tremula*.
