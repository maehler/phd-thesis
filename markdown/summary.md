The emergence of complex traits in living organisms has been of interest to biologists since the early days of biology. Domestication and breeding has resulted in the most remarkable transformations, such as the grass teosinte turning into the cornstalks of today, or the variation that can be seen among different breeds of dogs. In the mid 19th century, Gregor Mendel uncovered the basics of genetic inheritance and was able to explain the passing down of traits in peas. Not all traits are however this simple to dissect since they are controlled by several genes; these are collectively called complex traits. Due the huge number of possible gene combinations it is simply not possible to do an exhaustive search of this space. New sequencing technologies however makes it possible to integrate data from multiple sources in order to narrow down and focus on the functional parts of this huge search space.

Variations in the genome sequence is what generally is associated with the phenotypes of interest, but this is of little interest unless more information is available. The changes in genome sequence are manifested as changes in gene expression levels, or changes in protein sequences (and possibly protein function), to mention a few examples. In order to get a complete picture of how phenotypes change based on changes in genome sequence, the intermediate layers (gene expression, protein abundance, metabolite abundance) must be included as well.

With this thesis, we aim to shine some light on gene regulation and the emergence of complex traits. In paper I gene regulation in the cyanobacterium *Synechocystis* is explored by integrating regulatory motifs with co-expression networks. Paper II concerns the determination of sex in *Populus tremula* using phenotype data, gene expression data, and genotype data. In paper III, the focus is directed towards the genetic component of gene expression (eQTL) and how this fits into a co-expression network context. Finally, paper IV expands on this by adding genotype--phenotype associations in addition to eQTLs and gene expression to explain leaf shape in *Populus tremula*.
