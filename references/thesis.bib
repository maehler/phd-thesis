abstract = {The synthesis of enzymes in bacteria follows a double genetic control. The socalled structural genes determine the molecular organization of the proteins. Other, functionally specialized, genetic determinants, called regulator and operator genes, control the rate of protein synthesis through the intermediacy of cytoplasmic components or repressors. The repressors can be either inactivated (induction) or activated (repression) by certain specific metabolites. This system of regulation appears to operate directly at the level of the synthesis by the gene of a shortlived intermediate, or messenger, which becomes associated with the ribosomes where protein synthesis takes place.},

@article{Doig2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biopsies taken from individual tumours exhibit extensive differences in their cellular composition due to the inherent heterogeneity of cancers and vagaries of sample collection. As a result genes expressed in specific cell types, or associated with certain biological processes are detected at widely variable levels across samples in transcriptomic analyses. This heterogeneity also means that the level of expression of genes expressed specifically in a given cell type or process, will vary in line with the number of those cells within samples or activity of the pathway, and will therefore be correlated in their expression.

RESULTS: Using a novel 3D network-based approach we have analysed six large human cancer microarray datasets derived from more than 1,000 individuals. Based upon this analysis, and without needing to isolate the individual cells, we have defined a broad spectrum of cell-type and pathway-specific gene signatures present in cancer expression data which were also found to be largely conserved in a number of independent datasets.

CONCLUSIONS: The conserved signature of the tumour-associated macrophage is shown to be largely-independent of tumour cell type. All stromal cell signatures have some degree of correlation with each other, since they must all be inversely correlated with the tumour component. However, viewed in the context of established tumours, the interactions between stromal components appear to be multifactorial given the level of one component e.g. vasculature, does not correlate tightly with another, such as the macrophage.},

abstract = {KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic information with higher order functional information. The genomic information is stored in the GENES database, which is a collection of gene catalogs for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes with up-to-date annotation of gene functions. The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ ).},

abstract = {Darwin’s finches, inhabiting the Gala´pagos archipelago and Cocos Island, constitute an iconic model for studies of speciation and adaptive evolution. Herewe report the results of whole-genome re-sequencing of 120 individuals representing all of the Darwin’s finch species and two close relatives. Phylogenetic analysis reveals important discrepancies with the phenotype-based taxonomy. We find extensive evidence for interspecific gene flow throughout the radiation. Hybridization has given rise to species of mixed ancestry. A 240 kilobase haplotype encompassing the ALX1 gene that encodes a transcription factor affecting craniofacial development is strongly associated with beak shape diversity across Darwin’s finch species as well as within the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis), a species that has undergone rapid evolution of beak shape in response to environmental changes. The ALX1 haplotype has contributed to diversification of beak shapes among the Darwin’s finches and, thereby, to an expanded utilization of food resources.},

@article{Abzhanov2006,
abstract = {A classic textbook example of adaptive radiation under natural selection is the evolution of 14 closely related species of Darwin's finches (Fringillidae, Passeriformes), whose primary diversity lies in the size and shape of their beaks. Thus, ground finches have deep and wide beaks, cactus finches have long and pointed beaks (low depth and narrower width), and warbler finches have slender and pointed beaks, reflecting differences in their respective diets. Previous work has shown that even small differences in any of the three major dimensions (depth, width and length) of the beak have major consequences for the overall fitness of the birds. Recently we used a candidate gene approach to explain one pathway involved in Darwin's finch beak morphogenesis. However, this type of analysis is limited to molecules with a known association with craniofacial and/or skeletogenic development. Here we use a less constrained, complementary DNA microarray analysis of the transcripts expressed in the beak primordia to find previously unknown genes and pathways whose expression correlates with specific beak morphologies. We show that calmodulin (CaM), a molecule involved in mediating Ca2+ signalling, is expressed at higher levels in the long and pointed beaks of cactus finches than in more robust beak types of other species. We validated this observation with in situ hybridizations. When this upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is artificially replicated in the chick frontonasal prominence, it causes an elongation of the upper beak, recapitulating the beak morphology of the cactus finches. Our results indicate that local upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is likely to have been a component of the evolution of Darwin's finch species with elongated beak morphology and provide a mechanistic explanation for the independence of beak evolution along different axes. More generally, our results implicate the CaM-dependent pathway in the developmental regulation of craniofacial skeletal structures.},

@article{Langfelder2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.

RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings.

CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.},

abstract = {A functional understanding of processes involved in adaptive divergence is one of the awaiting opportunities afforded by high-throughput transcriptomic technologies. Functional analysis of coexpressed genes has succeeded in the biomedical field in identifying key drivers of disease pathways. However, in ecology and evolutionary biology, functional interpretation of transcriptomic data is still limited. Here, we used Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of coexpressed genes in muscle and brain tissue of a lake whitefish backcross progeny. Modules were connected to gradients of known adaptive traits involved in the ecological speciation process between benthic and limnetic ecotypes. Key drivers, that is, hub genes of functional modules related to reproduction, growth, and behavior were identified, and module preservation was assessed in natural populations. Using this approach, we identified modules of coexpressed genes involved in phenotypic divergence and their key drivers, and further identified a module part specifically rewired in the backcross progeny. Functional analysis of transcriptomic data can significantly contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying ecological speciation. Our findings point to bone morphogenetic protein and calcium signaling as common pathways involved in coordinated evolution of trophic behavior, trophic morphology (gill rakers), and reproduction. Results also point to pathways implicating hemoglobins and constitutive stress response (HSP70) governing growth in lake whitefish.},

@article{Hodgkinson2010,
abstract = {Most SNPs in the human genome are biallelic; however, there are some sites that are triallelic. We show here that there are approximately twice as many triallelic sites as we would expect by chance. This excess does not appear to be caused by natural selection or mutational hotspots. Instead we propose that a new mutation can induce another mutation either within the same individual or subsequently during recombination. We provide evidence for this model by showing that the rarer two alleles at triallelic sites tend to cluster on phylogenetic trees of human haplotypes. However, we find no association between the density of triallelic sites and the rate of recombination, which leads us to suggest that triallelic sites might be generated by the simultaneous production of two new mutations within the same individual on the same genetic background. Under this model we estimate that simultaneous mutation contributes approximately 3{\%} of all distinct SNPs. We also show that there is a twofold excess of adjacent SNPs. Approximately half of these seem to be generated simultaneously since they have identical minor allele frequencies. We estimate that the mutation of adjacent nucleotides accounts for a little less than 1{\%} of all SNPs.},

Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60{\%} of heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast growth factors, WNT/$\beta$-catenin and chondroitin sulfate-related genes.

abstract = {Genetic variants, including single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs), in the non-coding regions of the human genome can play an important role in human traits and complex diseases. Most of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals map to non-coding regions and potentially point to non-coding variants, whereas their functional interpretation is challenging. In this review, we discuss the human non-coding variants and their contributions to human diseases in the following four parts. (i) Functional annotations of non-coding SNPs mapped by GWAS: we discuss recent progress revealing some of the molecular mechanisms for GWAS signals affecting gene function. (ii) Technical progress in interpretation of non-coding variants: we briefly describe some of the technologies for functional annotations of non-coding variants, including the methods for genome-wide mapping of chromatin interaction, computational tools for functional predictions and the new genome editing technologies useful for dissecting potential functional consequences of non-coding variants. (iii) Non-coding CNVs in human diseases: we review our emerging understanding the role of non-coding CNVs in human disease. (iv) Compound inheritance of large genomic deletions and non-coding variants: compound inheritance at a locus consisting of coding variants plus non-coding ones is described.},

abstract = {Changes in gene expression underlie the adaptive evolution in many complex phenotypes, and the recent increase in the availability of multi-species comparative transcriptome data has made it possible to scan whole transcriptomes for loci that have experienced adaptive changes in expression. However, despite the increase in data availability, current models of gene expression evolution often do not account for the complexities and inherent noise associated with transcriptome data. Additionally, in contrast to current models of gene sequence evolution, models of transcriptome evolution often lack the sophistication to effectively determine whether transcriptional differences between species or within a clade are the result of neutral or adaptive processes. In this review, we discuss the tools, methods and models that define our current understanding of the relationship between gene expression and complex phenotype evolution. Our goal is to summarize what we know about the evolution of global gene expression patterns underlying complex traits, as well to identify some of the questions that remain to be answered. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The evolutionary forces that maintain genetic variation in quantitative traits within populations remain poorly understood. One hypothesis suggests that variation is under purifying selection, resulting in an excess of low-frequency variants and a negative correlation between minor allele frequency and selection coefficients. Here, we test these predictions using the genetic loci associated with total expression variation (eQTLs) and allele-specific expression variation (aseQTLs) mapped within a single population of the plant Capsella grandiflora. In addition to finding eQTLs and aseQTLs for a large fraction of genes, we show that alleles at these loci are rarer than expected and exhibit a negative correlation between phenotypic effect size and frequency. Overall, our results show that the distribution of frequencies and effect sizes of the loci responsible for local expression variation within a single outcrossing population are consistent with the effects of purifying selection.},

abstract = {In many applications, one is interested in determining which of the properties of a network module change across conditions. For example, to validate the existence of a module, it is desirable to show that it is reproducible (or preserved) in an independent test network. Here we study several types of network preservation statistics that do not require a module assignment in the test network. We distinguish network preservation statistics by the type of the underlying network. Some preservation statistics are defined for a general network (defined by an adjacency matrix) while others are only defined for a correlation network (constructed on the basis of pairwise correlations between numeric variables). Our applications show that the correlation structure facilitates the definition of particularly powerful module preservation statistics. We illustrate that evaluating module preservation is in general different from evaluating cluster preservation. We find that it is advantageous to aggregate multiple preservation statistics into summary preservation statistics. We illustrate the use of these methods in six gene co-expression network applications including 1) preservation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in mouse tissues, 2) comparison of human and chimpanzee brain networks, 3) preservation of selected KEGG pathways between human and chimpanzee brain networks, 4) sex differences in human cortical networks, 5) sex differences in mouse liver networks. While we find no evidence for sex specific modules in human cortical networks, we find that several human cortical modules are less preserved in chimpanzees. In particular, apoptosis genes are differentially co-expressed between humans and chimpanzees. Our simulation studies and applications show that module preservation statistics are useful for studying differences between the modular structure of networks.

Unfortunately, we still understand only a small fraction, which is locating where genes are and deciphering the proteins they code for. The next step is to understand how the correct amount of gene products are produced in space and time to obtain a fully functioning organism, from the egg to the adult. This is what is known as the regulatory genome, a term coined by Eric H. Davidson. In this review, we examine what we know about gene regulation from a genomic point of view, revise the current in silico, in vitro and in vivo methodological approaches to study transcriptional regulation, and point to the power of phylogenetic footprinting as a guide to regulatory element discovery. The advantages and limitations of each approach are considered, with the emerging view that only large-scale studies and data-crunching will give us insight into the language of genomic regulatory systems, and allow the discovery of regulatory codes in the genome.},

abstract = {We conducted a study of natural variation in functional leaf traits and herbivory in 116 clones of European aspen, Populus tremula L., the Swedish Aspen (SwAsp) collection, originating from ten degrees of latitude across Sweden and grown in a common garden. In surveys of phytophagous arthropods over two years, we found the aspen canopy supports nearly 100 morphospecies. We identified significant broad-sense heritability of plant functional traits, basic plant defence chemistry, and arthropod community traits. The majority of arthropods were specialists, those coevolved with P. tremula to tolerate and even utilize leaf defence compounds. Arthropod abundance and richness were more closely related to plant growth rates than general chemical defences and relationships were identified between the arthropod community and stem growth, leaf and petiole morphology, anthocyanins, and condensed tannins. Heritable genetic variation in plant traits in young aspen was found to structure arthropod community; however no single trait drives the preferences of arthropod folivores among young aspen genotypes. The influence of natural variation in plant traits on the arthropod community indicates the importance of maintaining genetic variation in wild trees as keystone species for biodiversity. It further suggests that aspen can be a resource for the study of mechanisms of natural resistance to herbivores.},

abstract = {Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping aims to determine genomic regions that regulate gene transcription. Expression QTL is used to study the regulatory structure of normal tissues and to search for genetic factors in complex diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cystic fibrosis. A modern eQTL dataset contains millions of SNPs and thousands of transcripts measured for hundreds of samples. This makes the analysis computationally complex as it involves independent testing for association for every transcript-SNP pair. The heavy computational burden makes eQTL analysis less popular, often forces analysts to restrict their attention to just a subset of transcripts and SNPs. As larger genotype and gene expression datasets become available, the demand for fast tools for eQTL analysis increases. We present a new method for fast eQTL analysis via linear models, called Matrix eQTL. Matrix eQTL can model and test for association using both linear regression and ANOVA models. The models can include covariates to account for such factors as population structure, gender, and clinical variables. It also supports testing of heteroscedastic models and models with correlated errors. In our experiment on large datasets Matrix eQTL was thousands of times faster than the existing popular software for QTL/eQTL analysis. Matrix eQTL is implemented as both Matlab and R packages and thus can easily be run on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux systems.

abstract = {Global transcript expression experiments are commonly used to investigate the biological processes that underlie complex traits. These studies can exhibit complex patterns of pleiotropy when trans-acting genetic factors influence overlapping sets of multiple transcripts. Dissecting these patterns into biological modules with distinct genetic etiology can provide models of how genetic variants affect specific processes that contribute to a trait. Here we identify transcript modules associated with pleiotropic genetic factors and apply genetic interaction analysis to disentangle the regulatory architecture in a mouse intercross study of kidney function. The method, called the combined analysis of pleiotropy and epistasis (CAPE), has been previously used to model genetic networks for multiple physiological traits. It simultaneously models multiple phenotypes to identify direct genetic influences as well as influences mediated through genetic interactions. We first identify candidate trans expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and the transcripts potentially affected. We then clustered the transcripts into modules of co-expressed genes, from which we compute summary module phenotypes. Finally, we applied CAPE to map the network of interacting module QTL (modQTL) affecting the gene modules. The resulting network mapped how multiple modQTL both directly and indirectly affect modules associated with metabolic functions and biosynthetic processes. This work demonstrates how the integration of pleiotropic signals in gene expression data can be used to infer a complex hypothesis of how multiple loci interact to co-regulate transcription programs, thereby providing additional constraints to prioritize validation experiments.},

This picture has changed with advances in the systematic annotation of functional noncoding elements. Evolutionary conservation, functional genomics, chromatin state, sequence motifs and molecular quantitative trait loci all provide complementary information about the function of noncoding sequences. These functional maps can help with prioritizing variants on risk haplotypes, filtering mutations encountered in the clinic and performing systems-level analyses to reveal processes underlying disease associations. Advances in predictive modeling can enable data-set integration to reveal pathways shared across loci and alleles, and richer regulatory models can guide the search for epistatic interactions. Lastly, new massively parallel reporter experiments can systematically validate regulatory predictions. Ultimately, advances in regulatory and systems genomics can help unleash the value of whole-genome sequencing for personalized genomic risk assessment, diagnosis and treatment.},

abstract = {Understanding how DNA sequence variation is translated into variation for complex phenotypes has remained elusive but is essential for predicting adaptive evolution, for selecting agriculturally important animals and crops, and for personalized medicine. Gene expression may provide a link between variation in DNA sequence and organismal phenotypes, and its abundance can be measured efficiently and accurately. Here we quantified genome-wide variation in gene expression in the sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), increasing the annotated Drosophila transcriptome by 11{\%}, including thousands of novel transcribed regions (NTRs). We found that 42{\%} of the Drosophila transcriptome is genetically variable in males and females, including the NTRs, and is organized into modules of genetically correlated transcripts. We found that NTRs often were negatively correlated with the expression of protein-coding genes, which we exploited to annotate NTRs functionally. We identified regulatory variants for the mean and variance of gene expression, which have largely independent genetic control. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for the mean, but not for the variance, of gene expression were concentrated near genes. Notably, the variance eQTLs often interacted epistatically with local variants in these genes to regulate gene expression. This comprehensive characterization of population-scale diversity of transcriptomes and its genetic basis in the DGRP is critically important for a systems understanding of quantitative trait variation.},
